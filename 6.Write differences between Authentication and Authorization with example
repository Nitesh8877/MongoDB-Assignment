Write differences between Authentication and Authorization with example

Authenntication-> authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device.
                  This usually involves the user providing a set of credentials, such as a 
                  username and password which are checked against a database of valid credentials.
                  If the proviede credentials are valid, the user is considered authenticated and is 
                  granted access to the resource.
                
                
 Authorization-> Authorization is the process of granting or denying acess to a resource based on the
                 authenticated user's permissions. This can involve checking the user's role or group
                 membership to determine what actions they are allowed to perform.
                 
                 
                 
                 Example-> 
                 
                 Imagine a website that allows registered users to create and publish articles.The 
                 website has a login page that users cac access by entering their username and 
                 password. This is the authentication process.
                 
                 Once a user is authenticated, they can access the article creation and publishing geatures 
                 of the website. However, not all users have the same permissions. Some users may only be
                 able to create articles, while otheres may have the additional permission to puclish article
                 that they have created. This is the authorization process.
                 
                 In this summary , Authentication process verifies the user's identity and grants them access to 
                 the website. The authorization process then determines what actions the user is allowed to perform based on theri
                permissions
